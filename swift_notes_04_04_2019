next exam is going to be a bit harder --remember to study yo

- tuples
 - can contain any types
  -> even different ones in one tuple
 - problems with tuple is that it might make the code a bit unreadable, since tuple.something --the something part could be pretty much anythinh
 -> could be a stored property, computed property or a member of a tuple


- string
 - string is a value type -> gets copied when passed or assigned
 - substrings are not copied -> until they are assigned

- algorithms
 - usually when talking about algorithm they talk about timecomplexity -> how many steps does it need to be done
 - run manually with pen and paper first
 - an average fast timecomplexity for sorting algorithm is n^2  but you can be faster --> quicksort is n log n (Tony Hoare)
 - insertion sort is the n^2
 - quicksort is n log n 

 - big Oh notation
  -> should give the upper bound of the given problem
 - omega lower bound -> theta tight bound
 

 -shuffle algortihm
 - the normal algorithm might have a bias 
 -> the fisher-yates version solves the bias by switching values only to the left of the index


 ADT's - Abstract Data Types
 - an example of ADT is queue, it has mehtods enqueue and dequeue for adding and removing elements
  -> the behaviour of the queue is FIFO first-in, first-out
 - linked list is one of the most common abstract data types
